## Problem 1  
Analyze data to understand the effects of several variables on a childâ€™s birth weight

### Load and clean the data
```{r}
birthweight_data =
  read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = "1", "female" = "2"),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    frace = fct_recode(frace, "White" = "1", "Black" = "2", "Asian" = "3", 
                       "Puerto Rican" = "4", "Other" = "8"),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    mrace = fct_recode(mrace, "White" = "1", "Black" = "2", "Asian" = "3", 
                       "Puerto Rican" = "4")
  )
```

### Model building - Backward elimination  
Start with all predictors in the model and eliminate one by one until all variables left in the model are significant. 
```{r}
birthweight_lm1 = lm(bwt ~ ., data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm1)
```

Remove **momage** since the p-value is very high - 0.98
```{r, eval=FALSE}
birthweight_lm2 = lm(bwt ~ . - momage, data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm2)
```

Remove **malform** because the p-value is 0.933
```{r, eval=FALSE}
birthweight_lm3 = lm(bwt ~ . - momage - malform, data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm3)
```

Remove **menarche**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
birthweight_lm4 = lm(bwt ~ . - momage - malform - menarche, data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm4)
```

Remove **ppwt**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
birthweight_lm5 = lm(bwt ~ . - momage - malform - menarche - ppwt, data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm5)
```

Remove **wtgain**
```{r}
birthweight_lm6 = lm(bwt ~ . - momage - malform - menarche - ppwt - wtgain, data = birthweight_data)
anova(birthweight_lm6)
```

Note that the p-values for the remaining variables in our model are all less than 0.05. The predictors include baby sex, head circumference, length, mother weight at deliery, family income, father's race, gestational age in weeks, mother height, race, parity, pre-pregnancy bmi, and smoking. 

### Plot of residuals against fitted values 
```{r warning=FALSE}
birthweight_data %>% 
  add_predictions(birthweight_lm6) %>% 
  add_residuals(birthweight_lm6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  ggtitle("Residuals vs. fitted values")
```

### Model Comparisons    
* Model 1: length at birth, gestational age  
* Model 2: head circumference, length, sex, and interactions (including the 3-way interaction)  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
crossval_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_data, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble),
    original_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ . - momage - malform - menarche - ppwt - wtgain,
                              data = .x)),
    mod1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks,
                          data = .x)),
    mod2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength +
                            bhead*babysex + blength*babysex +
                            bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x)),
    
    rmse_original_mod = map2_dbl(original_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod1 = map2_dbl(mod1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod2 = map2_dbl(mod2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )
```

Compare the RMSE for the models  
```{r}
crossval_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Cross-validated prediction error")
```

WE can see from the above plot that the model from the backward elimination method have the smallest RMSE and model 1 with the main effects length at birth and gestational age have the largest RMSE. 

## Problem 2
Load the 2017 Central Park weather data
```{r, message=FALSE}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

Simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities estimated from these data: r^2 and log(beta_0 * beta_1).

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. 

### Bootstrapping
```{r}
bootstrap_models =
  weather_df %>% 
  bootstrap(5000, id = "strap_number") %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x)),
  )
```

### R-squared
```{r}
r_squared =
  bootstrap_models %>% 
  mutate(results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(strap_number, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(strap_number, r.squared)
```

```{r}
r_squared %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of R-Squared")
```

From the plot above, we can see that the distribution of R-squared is approximately normal, with a little skew to the left. The mean of R-squared is about **`r round(mean(pull(r_squared, r.squared)))`**.

To find the 95% CI for R^2:
```{r}
r_squared_conf = 
r_squared %>%
  summarize(
    ci_lower = quantile(r.squared, 0.025),
    ci_upper = quantile(r.squared, 0.975)
  )
r_squared_conf
```
Thus, we are 95% confidant that the true mean R^2 value lies between **`r round(r_squared_conf$ci_lower, 2)`** and **`r round(r_squared_conf$ci_upper, 2)`**.
